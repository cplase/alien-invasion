# Alien Invasion!
This project is a game that was created with the Python module called Pygame.

It was also created with the help of Eric Matthes' *Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition* book.

I created this project to practice programming in Python.

There are three relevant files to this project:
1. `alien_invasion.py` - This is the main file that contains the `AlienInvasion` class — which contains a number of important attributes used in the game.
2. `settings.py` - This file contains the `Settings` class for initializing and controlling the game's behavior.
3. `ship.py` - This file contains the `Ship` class — which manages the player ship's position and draws the ship to the screen.
